# pythonTraining
This is a repository of completed python training exercises. Practice exercises were supplied from the website https://hackinscience.org. 
If you are trying to sharpen your skills or just refresh, check this site out!

I try to commment my excercises so that someone without any prior knowledge of the program would be able to modify and edit them.
